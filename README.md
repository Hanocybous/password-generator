# Welcome to the README for the `password-generator' repository.

A password generator is a program that generates random, secure, and complex passwords that can be used to protect sensitive data and online accounts. This password generator, written in Python, is a useful tool for users who want to create strong passwords that are difficult to guess or crack.

The program uses a variety of techniques to create passwords that are both secure and memorable, such as randomly selecting characters from a pool of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special symbols. The length of the password can be customized by the user, allowing them to create longer or shorter passwords depending on their needs.

In addition to generating passwords, this program also provides options for customizing the output format of the password, such as adding spaces or special characters between the characters, making it easier to remember or copy the password when needed.

Overall, this password generator is a valuable tool for users who want to create strong passwords quickly and easily. Its user-friendly interface and customizable options make it a great addition to any security-conscious individual's toolkit. The program is available as a GitHub repository, allowing users to easily access and contribute to its development.
